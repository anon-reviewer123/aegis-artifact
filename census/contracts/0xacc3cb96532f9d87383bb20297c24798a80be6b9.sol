/**
 * @dev AccessManager is a central contract to store the permissions of a system.
 *
 * A smart contract under the control of an AccessManager instance is known as a target, and will inherit from the
 * {AccessManaged} contract, be connected to this contract as its manager and implement the {AccessManaged-restricted}
 * modifier on a set of functions selected to be permissioned. Note that any function without this setup won't be
 * effectively restricted.
 *
 * The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of "roles" identified by an `uint64` and scoped
 * by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be
 * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).
 *
 * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:
 *
 * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.
 * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.
 * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.
 *
 * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.
 * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:
 *
 * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.
 * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.
 * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.
 * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.
 * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.
 *
 * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions
 * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).
 *
 * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that
 * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it
 * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of
 * the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.
 *
 * NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an
 * {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.
 * Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules
 * registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions
 * will be {AccessManager} itself.
 *
 * WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very
 * mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or
 * {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the ERC4626 "Tokenized Vault Standard" as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626[EIP-4626].
 *
 * This extension allows the minting and burning of "shares" (represented using the ERC20 inheritance) in exchange for
 * underlying "assets" through standardized {deposit}, {mint}, {redeem} and {burn} workflows. This contract extends
 * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the "shares" token represented by this
 * contract and not the "assets" token which is an independent contract.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning
 * with a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation
 * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial
 * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may
 * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by
 * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as
 * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].
 *
 * Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`
 * corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault
 * decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself
 * determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset
 * (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's
 * donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more
 * expensive than it is profitable. More details about the underlying math can be found
 * xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].
 *
 * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued
 * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets
 * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience
 * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the
 * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.
 *
 * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].

/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.
